ps5_drive.py — Drive the cart with a PS5 DualSense controller.

Reads the DualSense over pygame and commands both cart subsystems with
authority clamped by ``limits.py``:

  - Left stick X  → steering column (ODrive **POSITION + TRAP_TRAJ**, same
    planner as ``main.py`` sweeps). ``integrated`` slews a held target angle;
    ``absolute`` maps stick position to angle.
  - R2 trigger    → gas pedal target (Arduino Mega over USB serial)
  - L2 trigger    → brake pedal target (Arduino Mega over USB serial)

Gas is always clamped to
``effective_gas_cap(PS5_GAS_LIMIT) = min(GAS_POT_MAX, GLOBAL_SPEED_LIMIT, PS5_GAS_LIMIT)``
so the top-level governor in ``limits.py`` wins even if this script is
asked to push harder.

Modes (``--mode``):

  full      (default) steering + pedals
  steering  ODrive only; pedals are left alone
  pedals    pedals only; ODrive is not even opened

Expected Arduino pedal protocol (USB serial, 115200 baud, newline-terminated):

  ``G <value>``   gas target pot value (0.0 .. GAS_POT_MAX)
  ``B <value>``   brake target pot value (0.0 .. BRAKE_POT_MAX)
  ``S``           stop both actuators immediately

Safety:

  - The pygame window must be focused for input.
  - Esc / Q / close-window → graceful stop of everything that was opened.
  - ``--dry-run`` skips all hardware and just prints what would be sent,
    handy for checking input mapping without the cart present.

Stick steering (``--stick-steering``):

  ``integrated`` — stick slews a **target column angle** (°); the ODrive
  **trap trajectory** tracks it with the same vel/accel caps as calibration
  sweeps (``main.py``). Release the stick and the target (and wheel) **hold**.

  ``absolute`` — stick position maps directly to target angle; center → 0°.

Usage:

    uv run python scripts/ps5_drive.py                              # full, integrated steer
    uv run python scripts/ps5_drive.py --stick-steering absolute    # wheel follows stick
    uv run python scripts/ps5_drive.py --mode steering              # steering only
    uv run python scripts/ps5_drive.py --mode pedals                # pedals only
    uv run python scripts/ps5_drive.py --dry-run                    # no hardware

    macOS AppNap throttles the pygame main loop to ~1 Hz whenever the

    timeout. Both would then trip — the pedals would retract, the ODrive
    would IDLE — just because the operator alt-tabbed to Settings.

    This thread ticks at a fixed rate independent of the render loop.
    Each tick it:
      - writes a single ``H\\n`` byte to the Mega (the firmware treats
        any byte as a heartbeat, so the watchdog stays fed without
